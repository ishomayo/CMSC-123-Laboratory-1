# How to Run

To run the application, simply edit the source folders for every ImageIcon present in the code. 

To edit the source folders for every ImageIcon, follow these instructions:
  1. Find the source folder in your project directory where the source code for the application is stored (find the folder named **src**).
  2. For every ImageIcon, select appropriate file directory for respective buttons (such as **trainButton.png** for the ImageIcon for the train button, etc.).
  3. The following buttons have their respective files in the **src** folder:\
     a. Compress Button: compressButton.png\
     b. Open Compressed Button: openCompressed.png\
     c. Open New Button: openNew.png\
     d. Train Button: trainButton.png
  4. The following files have their respective files in the **Source Code** folder:\
     a. Background Photo: fullWindow.png\
     b. Image Preview Photo: imagePreview.png
  5. After finding the directories, copy and paste each for their respective ImageIcon in the lines of codes. For example:
     ```
     ImageIcon trainIcon = new ImageIcon("C:\\Users\\Eugene\\Desktop\\Git\\hi\\CMSC-125-Laboratory-1\\Source Code\\CMSC125Lab1\\src\\trainButton.png");
     ```
  6. Now you can run the application. It must look like this:<br/>
